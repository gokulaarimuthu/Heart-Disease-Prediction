# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various health-related features. The prediction model is implemented using a Jupyter Notebook and utilizes machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [Heart Disease UCI dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains various attributes related to heart health and a target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

## Requirements
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python (>=3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

You can install the dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gokulaarimuthu/heart-disease-prediction.git
   ```

2. Change directory to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd heart-disease-prediction
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Heart_Disease_Prediction.ipynb
   ```

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the code cells and train the prediction model.

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run each cell sequentially.
2. Follow the provided comments and documentation in the notebook for guidance.
3. Analyze the results and predictions made by the model.

## Model Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly predict the presence or absence of heart disease.

## Conclusion
The project aims to demonstrate the application of machine learning in predicting heart disease based on health-related features. Feel free to experiment with different algorithms, hyperparameters, and feature selections to further improve the model's performance.
